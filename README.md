🚀 Excited to Share My Flipkart Clone Project! 🛍️ 
 
I’ve just completed building a Flipkart Online Shopping Clone using HTML and CSS! 🎨👨‍💻 
 
This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills, focusing on: 
 
- Building responsive layouts to ensure seamless browsing across devices 📱💻 
- Creating a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation 🔍 
- Styling and structuring pages to mimic the aesthetic and functionality of the popular Flipkart platform 🌟 
 
Key highlights:
- Login Page
- Clean, modern UI

This project has helped me further develop my skills in HTML and CSS while gaining a deeper understanding of e-commerce site architecture.
